Hi all! I'm Yin!

First off, thank you so much for joining me in this journey! This blog is the findings of what each ingredient does in the baking process and stories of my successes and failures. I love baking from other people’s recipes, but can’t seem to make my own since I have no idea what each ingredient does. So this is me figuring out what each ingredient does and sharing the results. A big shout out to the online baking community who has been sharing their creations and recipes so generously, and this is my small way of contributing to that community.

Baking is amazing. It’s creative, it’s fun, it’s a great way to express oneself and it is just DELICIOUS!!! Hopefully you will find this blog helpful and inspires you to create more love in the world! Anyways, please <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}">check out some posts </a> or <a href="/contact/">drop me a note</a>. Can’t wait to see your creations too!

Happy baking!
