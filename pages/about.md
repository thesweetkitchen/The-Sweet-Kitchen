  Hi all! I'm Yin!
</p>

<p>
  First off all, thank you so much for joining me in this journey! This blog is a summary of experiments to find out what each ingredient does in the baking process and stories of my successes and failures. The Sweet Kitchen came to be because while I enjoyed using other people’s recipes, I can’t seem to make my own since I have no idea what each ingredient does. A big shout out to the online baking community who has been sharing their creations and recipes so generously, and this is my small way of contributing to this community.

  Baking is amazing. It’s creative, it’s fun, it’s a great way to express oneself and it is just DELICIOUS!!! Hopefully you will find this blog helpful and inspires you to create more love in the world! Anyways, please <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}">check out some posts</a> or <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/contact/">drop me a note</a>. Can’t wait to see your creations too!
</p>

<p>
  Happy baking!
